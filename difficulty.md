# Difficulty of each problem  
### In the event that you actually want to try these questions yourself, here is an approximation of the difficulty (on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest) of each question *relative to other questions*. 
### This isn't a *general* measure of difficulty, but rather a *relative* one, meaning a 1/5 is not necessarily easy, but just easier (in my subjective opinion) than most of the other questions in this repository. 
### Due to the fact that these are brainteaser-style questions, I can't give an exact objective marker as to what 1/5 and 5/5 represent. Roughly, however, a 1/5 can be solved with a creative insight most STEM majors can think of in an exam setting, while a 5/5 approaches olympiad difficulty. 

**Q1:** 4/5  
**Q2:** 4/5  
**Q3:** 1/5  
**Q4:** 3/5  
**Q5:** 2/5  
**Q6:** 1/5  
**Q7:** 4/5  
**Q8:** 3/5  
**Q9:** 5/5  
**Q10:** 2/5
