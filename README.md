# MathProblems
Collection of short math problems I found interesting, primarily based on probability and combinatorics. These problems come from a variety of sources: class tutorials, quant interviews, or the occasional Google/StackExchange rabbit hole I find myself in.  

Many of these questions are rooted in simple concepts of probability theory being applied in a complex or tricky way and thus require very little preexisting knowledge. It is also important to note that I personally have very little formal math education. I am an engineering major minoring in math, and have primarily taken applied math clases in calculus, ODEs/PDEs, linear algebra, and probability. I only took 1-2 semesters of analysis and abstract algebra. As a result, it is entirely possible that someone with a greater degree of mathematical maturity than me (ie. an upper-undergraduate math major) would find many of these questions trivial or easy.

### [1. Expected Number of Children](Problems/Q1.md)  
A couple decide to have children until they have more boys than girls. What is the expected number of children they will have? Note that this means that if their first child is a boy, they will immediately stop.  
### [2. 30-Sided Die Game](Problems/Q2.md)  
Two players are presented with a 30-sided die. The first player chooses a number between 1 and 30. The second player can then choose a number between 1 and 30 (they may not choose the same number as the first player). The die is then rolled and the person whose choice is closest to the die roll gets money equal to the die roll. Is it preferable to go first or second, and what strategy should be applied?
### [3. Cointoss Game](Problems/Q3.md)  
Two gamblers are playing a coin toss game. Gambler A has n + 1 fair coins, while gambler B has n fair coins. If both toss all their coins, what is the probability that gambler A flips more heads than gambler B?  
### [4. Points in a Circle](Problems/Q4.md)  
N points are randomly placed on the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that they are all within a semicircle?
### [5. Chess Tournament](Problems/Q5.md)  
A chess tournament has $2^n$ players with different skill levels. A player with a higher skill level will always beat a player with a lower skill level. The players are placed in a traditional knockout bracket, but opponents are chosen randomly after each round. What are the odds that the 2nd best player faces the best player in the final?  
### [6. Die Rolls](Problems/Q6.md)  
You roll four 6-sided dice and multiply all four results. What is the probability that this value is an even number?
### [7. Unbalanced Coin](Problems/Q7.md)  
You have a biased coin with a probability $p$ of tossing heads and $1-p$ of tossing tails. You toss it until you get two heads in a row. How many times do you expect to toss it?
### [8. Poker Straights](Problems/Q8.md)
Consider a game that consists of randomly dealing out three hands of four cards from a deck of 12 cards. The deck contains four Aces, four Kings, two Queens, and two Jacks. What is the probability that at least one of the hands has all four different denominations?
