# MathProblems
Collection of short math problems I found interesting, primarily based on probability and combinatorics. These problems come from a variety of sources: class tutorials, quant interviews, or the occasional Google/StackOverflow rabbit hole I find myself in.  

Many of these questions are rooted in simple concepts of probability theory being applied in a complex or tricky way and thus require very little preexisting knowledge. It is also important to note that I personally have very little formal math education. I am an engineering major minoring in math, and have primarily taken applied math clases in calculus, ODEs/PDEs, linear algebra, and probability. I only took 1-2 semesters of analysis and abstract algebra. As a result, it is entirely possible that someone with a greater degree of mathematical maturity than me (ie. an upper-undergraduate math major) would find many of these questions trivial or easy.

### [1. Expected Number of Children](Problems/Q1.md)  
A couple decide to have children until they have more boys than girls. What is the expected number of children they will have? Note that this means that if their first child is a boy, they will immediately stop.  
### [2. 30-Sided Die Game](Problems/Q2.md)  
Two players are presented with a 30-sided die. The first player chooses a number between 1 and 30. The second player can then choose a number between 1 and 30 (they may not choose the same number as the first player). The die is then rolled and the person whose choice is closest to the die roll gets money equal to the die roll. Is it preferable to go first or second, and what strategy should be applied?
### [3. Cointoss Game](Problems/Q3.md)  
Two gamblers are playing a coin toss game. Gambler A has n + 1 fair coins, while gambler B has n fair coins. If both toss all their coins, what is the probability that gambler A flips more heads than gambler B?  
### [4. Points in a Circle](Problems/Q4.md)  
N points are randomly placed on the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that they are all within a semicircle?
