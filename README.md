# MathProblems
Collection of short math problems I found interesting, primarily based on probability and combinatorics. These problems come from a variety of sources: class tutorials, quant interviews, or the occasional Google/StackOverflow rabbit hole I find myself in.  

Many of these questions are rooted in simple concepts of probability theory being applied in a complex or tricky way and thus require very little preexisting knowledge. It is also important to note that I personally have very little formal math education. I am an engineering major minoring in math, and have primarily taken applied math clases in calculus, ODEs/PDEs, linear algebra, and probability. I only took 1-2 semesters of analysis and abstract algebra. As a result, it is entirely possible that someone with a greater degree of mathematical maturity than me (ie. an upper-undergraduate math major) would find many of these questions trivial or easy.
