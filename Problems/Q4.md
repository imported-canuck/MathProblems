# Question 4 - Points on a Circle  

## N points are randomly placed on the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that they are all in a semicircle?  

### Context  
Also from the Green Book. This one stumped me and I had to look at the solution. The solution in the book did feel quite convoluted, so I've tried to make it a bit more clear here.  

### Solution  
Consider the first point, lets label it $i_1$. We draw a clockwise arc originating from $i_1$ and ending after 180&deg;. The choice of this arc being clockwise is arbitrary, we could do the same thing with a counterclockwise arc. The important thing here is that the semicircle that is created by this arc starts at $i_1$, and ends on the point on the circle opposite to it. The probability of a given point (disregarding $i_1$, as it by definition *makes up* the semicircle and is thus considered in it) lying on this arc is 0.5 (cause the semicircle is half the size of the circle, duh). Thus the odds of *all* remaining $N-1$ points lying on this semicircle is:  

$$
\large \frac{1}{2^{N-1}}
$$  

But this isn't the only way we can confirm that all points lie within a single semicircular arc. We recall that we bounded this semicircular arc by $i_1$. But we could also bound it by $i_2$, or $i_3$, and so on. We only need *one single* bounding point to work in order to be able to say that all points lie on *a* semicircular arc.  

Well, we have $N$ points. If any one of them crete a semicircular arc that contains all points, then we're done. So can we multiply $\frac{1}{2^{N-1}}$ by $N$? Not immediately. In order for us to be
