# Question 7 - Unbalanced Coin

## You have a biased coin with a probability $p$ of tossing heads and $1-p$ of tossing tails. You toss it until you get two heads in a row. How many times do you expect to toss it?

### Context  
The question was given as a bonus question on a practice final exam for MATH 356 (Honours Probability) at McGill. It looks like a pretty tough question at first but becomes very simple when you come up with the idea to split the problem up into two states and solve the recurrence relation. I thought of it as I had covered FSMs in a separate (engineering) class that week, which operate in a similar manner. 

### Solution  
TBD
