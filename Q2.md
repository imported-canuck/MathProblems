# Question 2 - 30-Sided Die Game  

## Two players are presented with a 30-sided die. The first player chooses a number between 1 and 30. The second player can then choose a number between 1 and 30 (they may not choose the same number as the first player). The die is then rolled and the person whose choice is closest to the die roll gets money equal to the die roll. Is it preferable to go first or second, and what strategy should be applied?  

### Context  
Someone asked this question in a math Discord server. It caught my attention and I spent the better part of an hour figuring this (and the proceeding more general case) out. I was supposed to be studying for a probability midterm the next day. Thankfully, it was easier than this question.  

### Solution  
This is actually a pretty intuitive and straightforward question to solve. The optimal choice for P1 (regardless of if P2 is able to beat him) is logically somewhere between 15 and 30. Trial and error will give you the correct answer fairly quickly, but I think this is a more systematic solution.  

Let $x_1$ be P1's choice and $x_2$ be P2's choice. It is evident that P2's optimal response must be $x_1 + 1$ or $x_1 - 1$. Any other choice will underperform relative to the aforementioned that is closest to it. For example $x_1 + 3$ will necessarily underperform relative to $x_1 + 1$, since it captures a smaller subset of the possible outcomes. Considering the extremes, if $x_1 = 2$, P2 should respond with $x_2 = x_1 + 1$. Likewise, if $x_1 = 29$, P2 should respond with $x_2 = x_1 - 1$. Since lower choices of $x_1$ lend itself to $x_2 = x_1 + 1$ and vice versa, there will be a "flipping point" at which P2's optimal decision shifts from $x_1 + 1$ to $x_1 - 1$.  

Thus, the expected payoff of choosing $x_1 + 1$ is greater than choosing $x_1 - 1$ if:  

$$
\large \frac{1}{30} \sum_{d=x_1+1}^{30} d \geq \frac{1}{30} \sum_{d=1}^{x_1-1} d
$$

The 1/30 term on both sides represent the probability of any die roll $x$. The left hand side then iterates from $x_1 + 1$ to 30. Multiplying these values by the probability of it occuring (1/30) gives P2's expected earnings from choosing $x_1 + 1$. Likewise, the right hand side gives P2's expected earnings from choosing $x_1 - 1$, as it iterates from 1 to $x_1 - 1$.  

The 1/30 on both sides cancel out. The sum on the right hand side is fairly easy, as it is the arithmetic sum from 1 to $x_1 - 1$. There are multiple ways to solve the sum on the left hand side. One is to consider it as the difference between the arithmetic sum from 1 to 30 and the arithmetic sum from 1 to $x_1 + 1$. This yields a difference of two standard equations for the sum of an arithmetic series, as such:  

$$
\large \frac{30*31}{2} - \frac{x_1(x_1+1)}{2} \geq \frac{(x_1-1)x_1}{2}
$$

Simplifying yields:  

$$
\large 930 - x_1^2 - x_1 \geq x_1^2 - x_1
$$

The first-order terms cancel and the final answer is $x_1 \leq \sqrt{465} \approx 21.56$. To recap, this means that if P1 picks 21 or below, P2 should pick $x_1 + 1$ and if P1 picks 22 or above, P2 should pick $x_1 - 1$. The intuitive step here is that either 21 or 22 should be P1's optimal pick. One can reason this by recognizing that the advantage P2 can derive by selecting $x_1 - 1$ or $x_1 + 1$ erodes at 21.56, meaning that (if it was possible) P1 selecting 21.56 would result P2 to have the same expected gain regardless of if he selects $x_1 - 1$ or $x_1 + 1$.  

The total gain to be captured from this game is simply the expected value of the dice roll, $(30+1)/2 = 15.5$. If P1 picks 21, P2 will respond with 22, causing P1's expected gain to be

$$
\frac{1}{30} \large \sum_{n=1}^{21} n = \frac{1}{30} \frac{21*22}{2} = 7.7
$$

In this case, P2's gain will be the complement of this value (15.5 - 7.7 = 7.8)

If P1 picks 22, P2 will respond with 21. We can go through the same set of calculations to find P1's expected gain, or we can recognize that this is simply the previous scenario (P1 picking 21 and P2 responding with 22) with the players reversed. Hence, P1's expected gain from this will be 7.8, while P2's expected gain is relegated to 7.7. Therefore, **It is preferable to go first, and select 22**.
