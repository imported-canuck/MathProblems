# Question 2 - 30-Sided Die Game  

## Two players are presented with a 30-sided die. The first player chooses a number between 1 and 30. The second player can then choose a number between 1 and 30 (they may not choose the same number as the first player). The die is then rolled and the person whose choice is closest to the die roll gets money equal to the die roll. Is it preferable to go first or second, and what strategy should be applied?  

### Context  
Someone asked this question in a math Discord server. It caught my attention and I spent the better part of an hour figuring this (and the proceeding more general case) out. I was supposed to be studying for a probability midterm the next day. Thankfully, it was easier than this question.  

### Solution  
This is actually a pretty intuitive and straightforward question to solve. The optimal choice for P1 (regardless of if P2 is able to beat him) is logically somewhere between 15 and 30. Trial and error will give you the correct answer fairly quickly, but I think this is a more systematic solution.  

Let $x_1$ be P1's choice and $x_2$ be P2's choice. It is evident that P2's optimal response must be $x_1 + 1$ or $x_1 - 1$. Any other choice will underperform relative to the aforementioned that is closest to it. For example $x_1 + 3$ will necessarily underperform relative to $x_1 + 1$, since it captures a smaller subset of the possible outcomes. Considering the extremes, if $x_1 = 2$, P2 should respond with $x_2 = x_1 + 1$. Likewise, if $x_1 = 29$, P2 should respond with $x_2 = x_1 - 1$. Since lower choices of $x_1$ lend itself to $x_2 = x_1 + 1$ and vice versa, there will be a "flipping point" at which P2's optimal decision shifts from $x_1 + 1$ to $x_1 - 1$.  

Thus, the expected payoff of choosing $x_1 + 1$ is greater than choosing $x_1 - 1$ if:  

$$
\large \frac{1}{30} \sum_{d=x_1+1}^{30} d \geq \frac{1}{30} \sum_{d=1}^{x_1-1} d
$$

The 1/30 term on both sides represent the probability of any die roll $x$. The left hand side then iterates from $x_1 + 1$ to 30. Multiplying these values by the probability of it occuring (1/30) gives P2s expected earnings from choosing $x_1 + 1$.
